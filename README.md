# CyberSecurityandmore_Resources

I like many am attempting to build my career into cyber security and more.  I have acquired a lot of resources for different learning opportunities and resources.  I've been wanting to organize them and share them with others also looking to learn new skills and build a career. 
This list is by no means comprehensive or the perfect representation of the best methods to learn something.  I hope that we can fine tune this and make it better.  I have broken down my experiences with some of these resources at my personal page https://github.com/HermitG1
